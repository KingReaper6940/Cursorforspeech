## Usage

### Starting Voice Transcription

There are multiple ways to start voice transcription:

1. **üéØ Editor Toolbar Button** (NEW!): 
   - Look for the microphone (üé§) icon in the top-right of your editor
   - Click it to start/stop recording

2. **‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcut**: 
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (or `Cmd+Shift+V` on Mac)

3. **üìù Right-Click Menu**: 
   - Right-click in any editor and select "Start Voice Prompt"

4. **üìä Status Bar**: 
   - Click the prominent microphone icon in the status bar (bottom right)

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
   - Type "Start Voice Prompt" and press Enter

### Recording Process

1. **Grant Permissions**: On first use, your browser will request microphone access
2. **Start Speaking**: Once recording begins, speak clearly into your microphone
3. **Stop Recording**: Click the status bar item again or wait for automatic stop
4. **View Results**: Transcribed text will be inserted at your cursor position

### Status Bar Indicators

- `üé§ Ready` - Extension is ready to record
- `üé§ Recording... (Click to stop)` - Currently recording audio
- `üé§ Transcribing with Whisper...` - Processing audio with local AI
- `üé§ Transcribing with Web Speech API...` - Using browser fallback

## Technology Stack

### Primary: Whisper Model (@xenova/transformers)
- **Accuracy**: High-quality local transcription
- **Privacy**: No data leaves your machine
- **Languages**: Optimized for English (whisper-tiny.en model)
- **Performance**: Runs efficiently in the browser

### Fallback: Web Speech API
- **Compatibility**: Works when Whisper model can't load
- **Speed**: Real-time transcription
- **Limitations**: Requires internet connection and browser support

## Requirements

- VS Code version 1.74.0 or higher
- Modern browser with microphone support
- Microphone access permissions

### Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari (with Web Speech API)
- ‚úÖ Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Microphone access denied"**
- Grant microphone permissions in your browser
- Check VS Code/Cursor settings for media permissions

**"Whisper model failed to load"**
- The extension will automatically fallback to Web Speech API
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the initial model download

**"No speech detected"**
- Speak clearly and ensure your microphone is working
- Check your system's audio input settings
- Try speaking closer to the microphone

**"Web Speech API not supported"**
- Update to a modern browser version
- Use Chrome/Edge for best compatibility

### Performance Tips

- First-time Whisper model loading may take 30-60 seconds
- Subsequent uses will be much faster as the model is cached
- For best results, speak in a quiet environment

## Configuration

Currently, the extension works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults. Future versions may include:

- Language selection
- Model size options (tiny/base/small)
- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Audio quality settings
